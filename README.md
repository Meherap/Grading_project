# Grading Tool Project

This tool helps you enter grades for students and see the final grades based on a specific rubric.

## Way it Works:
1. Enter grades for homeworks, quizzes, midterm, and final project.
2. The tool automatically calculates the final grade, dropping the lowest quiz score.
3. You can view all students final grades in a table.

### Steps to follow:

#### 1. Enter Grades:
   - Open the 'test_grades.php' file in the browser.
   - You'll see a form where you need to enter the following:
     - **Student ID** (Use IDs 1-10).
     - Grades for **Homework 1-5**, **Quizzes 1-5**, **Midterm**, and **Final Project**.
   - Once entered all the grades, click **Submit Grades**.
   - It will calculate the final grade for that student and show a confirmation.

#### 2. View All Grades:
   - After entering grades, open the 'view_grades.php' file in browser.
   - This page will show a table of all students and their final grades based on the inputs provided.
